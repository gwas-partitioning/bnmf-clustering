## T2D Multi-ancestry Partitioned Polygenic Scores
Cluster weights are available from the [Smith, Deutsch et al Nature Medicine 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02865-3) paper in the "Smith_Deutsch_NatureMedicine_2024" folder. Partitioned polygenic scores (pPS) can be generated using the enclosed variant cluster weights. We have included weights for ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry clusters:

* In the weights files, the "Effect_Allele" column denotes the T2D risk-increasing allele.
* When generating the pPS, all genotypes should be aligned to this allele!
* Weights have been provided in hg38, however a liftover map (hg19 to hg38) is included in each subfolder.

## Pipeline for GWAS clustering using Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (bNMF)

The bNMF procedure, as applied here, detects clusters of GWAS variants for some outcome of interest based on the associations of those variants with a set of additional traits. The pipeline covers variant selection and QC, proxy variant search, z-score matrix preparation, clustering, and post-hoc summarization.

**Genome build:** hg19/GRCh37 for primary analysis; hg38 conversion is handled in the post-hoc step via liftover.

### Quick start

1. Copy `scripts/main_script_example.R` to your project folder and open it.
2. Fill in the **USER CONFIGURATION** section at the top (paths, thresholds, LDlink token).
3. Populate a copy of `example_data/clustering_data_source_example.xlsx` with paths to your own summary statistics files.
4. Run sections sequentially. Steps 2–3 (LD pruning via LDlink) are slow — run once and use `save.image()` / `load()` checkpoints to resume.

Sample input files are provided in `example_data/` to illustrate the expected formats.

### Requirements

**R packages:** `data.table`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, `magrittr`, `readxl`, `LDlinkR`, `furrr`, `parallelly`, `softImpute`, `strex`, `GenomicRanges`, `rtracklayer`, `Rsamtools`, `openxlsx`, `Homo.sapiens`, `vroom`

**LDlink API token:** Several steps use the [LDlinkR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=LDlinkR) package for LD-based operations. Request a free token at https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess and store it as the environment variable `LDLINK_TOKEN`.

**rsID map:** The proxy search step requires a per-chromosome file mapping `VAR_ID → rsID`. Generate it from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 using `scripts/generate_varid_to_rsid_map_file.R`, which downloads per-chromosome VCFs from Ensembl and writes one map file per chromosome to a local directory. Pass the directory path as `my_rsid_map_dir` in the USER CONFIGURATION section.

### Input data format

**Variant IDs:** All summary statistics files must use `VAR_ID` in `CHR_POS_REF_ALT` format (e.g. `1_123456_A_G`), with alleles aligned consistently across files. Chromosome should be numeric (no `chr` prefix).

**Summary statistics columns** (required): `VAR_ID`, `Effect_Allele_PH`, `P_VALUE`, and either `BETA`+`SE` or `ODDS_RATIO`. An `N_PH` (sample size) column is optional — sample sizes can also be supplied via the manifest Excel file.

**GWAS manifest (Excel):** The pipeline is configured via a two-sheet Excel workbook:
* **`main_gwas` sheet** — one row per GWAS study for the primary trait being clustered. Required columns: `study`, `trait`, `population`, `full_path` (path to summary stats file), `largest` (`Yes` for the study used to define the variant set).
* **`trait_gwas` sheet** — one row per additional trait used to characterize clusters. Required columns: `trait`, `full_path`, `sample_size`. Z-scores for each variant are computed from each trait's summary stats.

See `example_data/clustering_data_source_example.xlsx` for a working example of this format.

#### `format_bNMF_results.Rmd` — Results visualization
Generates an HTML report with heatmaps, cluster summary tables, and an optimal weight threshold calculation.
